0. The Baseline Snapshot

Goal: Capture the complete security state of a system before any changes, establishing the measurement that every subsequent task will improve against.

Context: You cannot prove hardening worked if you do not know where you started. This task captures the system as it is: unhardened, default configuration, every setting at its out-of-the-box value. Every number you record here is the number you will improve.

Instructions: Write a script 0-baseline_snapshot.sh that captures the complete security baseline of a Linux system. The script must:

    Record system identification (hostname, OS, kernel version, uptime)

    List all running services and their state

    List all open ports and listening sockets

    List all SUID and SGID binaries

    List all world-writable files (excluding /proc, /sys, /dev)

    Capture current sysctl security-relevant parameters

    Capture current SSH configuration settings

    Record active user accounts and sudo group membership

Expected Output:

```bash
$ sudo ./0-baseline_snapshot.sh
Hostname: billing-srv-01
OS: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
Running services: 24
Open ports: 11
SUID binaries: 23
SGID binaries: 12
World-writable files: 7
```
